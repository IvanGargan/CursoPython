      "Invoking Descriptors\n",
      "====================\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, a descriptor is an object attribute with \"binding\n",
      "behavior\", one whose attribute access has been overridden by methods\n",
      "in the descriptor protocol:  \"__get__()\", \"__set__()\", and\n",
      "\"__delete__()\". If any of those methods are defined for an object, it\n",
      "is said to be a descriptor.\n",
      "\n",
      "The default behavior for attribute access is to get, set, or delete\n",
      "the attribute from an object's dictionary. For instance, \"a.x\" has a\n",
      "lookup chain starting with \"a.__dict__['x']\", then\n",
      "\"type(a).__dict__['x']\", and continuing through the base classes of\n",
      "\"type(a)\" excluding metaclasses.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if the looked-up value is an object defining one of the\n",
      "descriptor methods, then Python may override the default behavior and\n",
      "invoke the descriptor method instead.  Where this occurs in the\n",
      "precedence chain depends on which descriptor methods were defined and\n",
      "how they were called.\n",
      "\n",
      "The starting point for descriptor invocation is a binding, \"a.x\". How\n",
      "the arguments are assembled depends on \"a\":\n",
      "\n",
      "Direct Call\n",
      "   The simplest and least common call is when user code directly\n",
      "   invokes a descriptor method:    \"x.__get__(a)\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Instance Binding\n",
      "   If binding to an object instance, \"a.x\" is transformed into the\n",
      "   call: \"type(a).__dict__['x'].__get__(a, type(a))\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Class Binding\n",
      "   If binding to a class, \"A.x\" is transformed into the call:\n",
      "   \"A.__dict__['x'].__get__(None, A)\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Super Binding\n",
      "   If \"a\" is an instance of \"super\", then the binding \"super(B,\n",
      "   obj).m()\" searches \"obj.__class__.__mro__\" for the base class \"A\"\n",
      "   immediately preceding \"B\" and then invokes the descriptor with the\n",
      "   call: \"A.__dict__['m'].__get__(obj, obj.__class__)\".\n",
      "\n",
      "For instance bindings, the precedence of descriptor invocation depends\n",
      "on the which descriptor methods are defined.  A descriptor can define\n",
      "any combination of \"__get__()\", \"__set__()\" and \"__delete__()\".  If it\n",
      "does not define \"__get__()\", then accessing the attribute will return\n",
      "the descriptor object itself unless there is a value in the object's\n",
      "instance dictionary.  If the descriptor defines \"__set__()\" and/or\n",
